                <h1> How to use a three card spread</h1>
                <h3>There's no one way to set out a spread.</h3>
                <p>People use tarot cards in different ways. Some use them as a spiritual practice; the cards are used
                    to
                    commune with spirits, deities, or just the cosmic energy of the universe. Some take a more secular
                    approach and use the cards as a meditative practice, using the cards to break outside of their
                    assumptions and gain a new persepctive.</p>
                <br>
                <h3>You assign the meanings of the position.</h3>
                <p>What those meanings are really don't matter, as long as you decide on all three <i>before</i> you
                    draw
                    the cards. Below is a list of ideas:</p>

                        <p><b>Past, Present, Future:</b> Most often used in spiritual practices, but it's not impossible
                            to
                            do a secular reading. This can be used to get a
                            general snapshot of a person, location, or object.</p>
                    </li>

                        <p><b>You, Your partner, Your relationship:</b> Used mostly in compatability readings, but can
                            also

                            conversation.
